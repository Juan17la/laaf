"""Shared humanoid rig for every LAAF character (segmented PS2-style, no skinning).

All characters face +Z, Y up, feet on y=0. The character's LEFT side is +X.
Each joint is a glTF node; geometry added after m.use("<Joint>") is in that
joint's local space (origin = the joint pivot). scripts/humanoid_anim.gd drives
these exact node names, so never rename them; proportions may change freely.

    Hips ─ Spine ─ (Neck ─) Head
         │       ├ UpperArmL ─ ForearmL ─ HandL
         │       └ UpperArmR ─ ForearmR ─ HandR
         ├ ThighL ─ ShinL ─ FootL
         └ ThighR ─ ShinR ─ FootR

Neck is optional and made for you: every character's head is still built on m.use("Head") (pivot at the
collar, as before); when the model is written, split_neck() moves the skin below the chin onto a Neck joint
at the old pivot and re-pivots Head at the top of the neck, so a turn or nod bends the neck instead of
swinging it from the collar like a block. humanoid_anim.gd shares head rotation between the two.

Limbs hang straight down from their joint (-Y). The foot pivot is the ankle;
toes point +Z. Hands hang down from the wrist.

Limbs are modelled on RIG's lengths; write time stretches them (below each pivot) to STRETCH's anatomical ones:
longer upper arm (elbow ~0.63 H, fingertips at mid-thigh), knee up to ~0.28 H. Overridden joints keep theirs.

SkirtL / SkirtR are optional too (skirt_joints): Hips children on the thigh pivots that humanoid_anim.gd swings
at ~0.6x the thigh, for long coats, robes and skirts (half_skirts) so a stride doesn't stab through the cloth.
